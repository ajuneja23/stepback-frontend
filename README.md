# StepBack: An NBA Social Media App

## Introduction
This is the frontend for Stepback, a WIP NBA social media app. To see the backend code, see [this repo](https://github.com/ajuneja23/stepback-backend "this repo").


## Project Description
Currently, the frontend allows the user to sign up or login. Passwords are encrypted and JSON web tokens are issued for authorization. Then, users can view all the posts or create their own new post. Backend development has other features implemented, such as deleting your account or filtering the posts you want to see, but this has not been implemented on the frontend yet. The frontend was created with React.js and Material UI components.
